            <h1>Preamble</h1>
            <p>Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, is a prominent figure in Chinese mythology and literature, best known from the novel Journey to the West. He possesses extraordinary superhuman strength and can transform into 72 different animals and objects. 
                Additionally, each of his hairs holds transformative powers, allowing him to manipulate wind, water, and fire. Though immensely powerful, Sun Wukong is also notorious for his short temper, impatience, and tendency towards anger, traits that often lead 
                him into conflict with both mortals and gods alike.

                <p>Sun Wukong, is born from a magical stone atop the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. After emerging as a stone monkey, he becomes the king of wild monkeys by leading them to a cave behind a waterfall. Seeking immortality, he finds the Taoist master 
                    Puti Zushi, who teaches him powerful martial arts and the Way of Immortality. Sun Wukong later defeats the Demon King of Confusion and acquires the magical, size-changing golden-banded staff from the Dragon King. He also gains royal armor and 
                    forms alliances with other powerful demons. Defying death, he erases his name from the Book of Life and Death, enraging the Jade Emperor, who repeatedly fails to eliminate him.

            <h1>Havoc in Heaven</h1>
            <p>The Jade Emperor invites the Monkey King to Heaven, giving him the lowly title of "Protector of the Horses." Realizing he's been tricked, Sun Wukong rebels and proclaims himself the "Great Sage, Heaven's Equal." The Jade Emperor, on advice, appeases 
                him with a new title and responsibility over the Heavenly Peach Garden. However, when Sun Wukong discovers he's excluded from a royal banquet, he defies Heaven, stealing the Pills and Peaches of Immortality and royal wine. The Monkey King then defeats 
                Heaven's armies, including its celestial warriors and gods, until Laozi's diamond ring subdues him. After 49 days in Laozi’s crucible, Sun Wukong emerges stronger and with fiery eyes capable of recognizing evil. He confronts the Jade Emperor, ready for further rebellion.

                <p>The Jade Emperor and Heaven's authorities appeal to the Buddha to intervene with Sun Wukong, who believes he deserves to be the new Jade Emperor. The Buddha challenges Sun Wukong to a bet, claiming the Monkey King cannot escape his palm. Confident, Wukong leaps to what he believes 
                    is the edge of the universe, marking one of five towering pillars as proof of his journey. After urinating on a pillar, he returns triumphantly to Buddha's palm, only to realize the pillars were the Buddha’s fingers. Unable to escape, Buddha traps Wukong under a mountain, sealing
                    him with a talisman and leaving him imprisoned for 500 years to learn humility. Two spirits feed him iron pellets and molten copper during his imprisonment.

            <header id="banner6">
                <p>Five hundred years after Sun Wukong's imprisonment, the Bodhisattva Guanyin seeks disciples to protect Tang Sanzang, a monk traveling to the West to retrieve Buddhist sutras. Sun Wukong offers to help in exchange for his freedom. To control him, Guanyin gives Tang Sanzang a magical 
                    circlet that causes Sun Wukong unbearable pain when a sutra is chanted. She also provides the Monkey King with three emergency-use hairs. Alongside companions Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing, Sun Wukong defends Tang Sanzang from demons, bandits, and supernatural beings, who seek to consume the monk's 
                    flesh for immortality. Throughout the journey, Sun Wukong learns Buddhist virtues and ultimately attains Buddhahood, becoming the "Victorious Fighting Buddha" for his loyalty and strength. He also demonstrates deep knowledge of fate, herbs, and healing during their trials.</p>
